The trajectory details the iterative development of a Web3 application, GenesisHQ, on a Next.js and Solana stack. The project evolved from a conceptual MVP to a more functional application through a series of rapid, user-driven changes. Initially, the work focused on building the UI, a simulated NFT minting flow, a client-side game, and integrating crypto price data. A significant portion of the development involved numerous UI/UX revisions based on user feedback, such as merging navigation tabs (NFT and Caviar into Crypto), updating branding (logos, headlines), and restructuring content within sections like the G Lounge.

A major technical pivot occurred late in the trajectory: the replacement of the initial, simple MongoDB-based authentication system with Supabase for user registration and email verification. This introduced new files (,  setup scripts,  guides) and required significant modifications to  to handle Supabase-specific authentication flows. Several troubleshooting cycles were necessary to resolve issues related to missing Supabase API keys (the  was initially omitted) and to improve the user experience around email verification, which was the final task being worked on. The user's primary language is English, but they occasionally use Norwegian, to which the AI has been adapting. The next agent should continue this practice.

<product_requirements>
GenesisHQ is a multi-faceted Web3 platform on the Solana blockchain. The goal is to create a seamless ecosystem for finance, exclusive collectibles, and gaming.

**Implemented Features:**
*   **Branding & UI:** A single-page application with a custom logo, background images, and a headline: Your money, your power, one Nexus.
*   **User Authentication:** A complete user registration and login system integrated with Supabase, including email verification and a Join Waitlist email capture popup.
*   **HUB Dashboard:** Displays live crypto prices from CoinGecko and includes text about the project's roadmap towards banking certifications.
*   **Crypto Tab:** A merged section combining:
    *   **NFT Collection:** A 10,000-piece collection with three tiers: 9,989 Codex Sketches, 10 Leonardo da Vinci Exclusives, and one Epic Leonardo Selfie with a ,000 prize. A 15% creator royalty is defined for secondary sales.
    *   **Caviar () Token:** A section for the platform's utility token with staking information.
*   **Minigames:** A playable, agar.io-style client-side game, formerly Play Arena.
*   **G Lounge:** A premium members-only area for Codex Collective members, detailing features like a Social HUB, 'Max' the trading bot, Minigames, and VIP benefits.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend/Auth:** Supabase (for user authentication, email verification), formerly Next.js API Routes with MongoDB.
- **Blockchain:** Solana Wallet Adapter () for frontend wallet connection simulation.
- **Data:** CoinGecko API for crypto prices.
- **Game:** HTML5 Canvas API for client-side game logic.
- **Deployment:** The application is hosted in a containerized environment with hot-reloading.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monolithic Next.js project where a single large client component () handles the UI, state, and logic for the entire single-page application. Authentication has been migrated from a custom API route to a client-side integration with Supabase.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key File Summaries:**

- ****
    - **Importance:** The application's central nervous system. A massive  component that manages all state (, , modals) and renders all sections conditionally.
    - **Changes:** This file has undergone extensive changes, including merging the 'NFT' and 'Caviar' tabs into a single 'Crypto' view, restructuring the 'G Lounge', and, most critically, replacing all MongoDB-based authentication logic (, ) with client-side Supabase functions (, ). It now includes state and handlers for an email whitelist popup and provides user feedback during the Supabase auth flow.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Defines the structure and metadata for the entire NFT collection.
    - **Changes:** Repeatedly modified to change the collection's composition. It now defines a three-tier structure (9,989 Sketches, 10 Exclusives, 1 Epic Selfie), includes a 15% royalty , and holds the image URLs for all NFT types.

- ** (Created)**
    - **Importance:** Centralizes the Supabase client initialization. It reads the Supabase URL and public anon key from  variables, creating a singleton client instance for use throughout the application. This is a crucial file for the new authentication architecture.

- ** (Modified)**
    - **Importance:** Stores all secrets and environment-specific configurations.
    - **Changes:** It was updated to include the Supabase project URL and keys: , , and . Correctly setting these is vital for the application to function.

- ** (Created)**
    - **Importance:** A critical instruction manual for the user.
    - **Changes:** Created to guide the user through the necessary manual steps of configuring custom email templates within their Supabase project dashboard, which is the root cause of the current email not received issue.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **User Action Required:** The user must run the SQL script in  in their Supabase project to create the necessary tables.
- **User Action Required:** The user must configure the email templates in their Supabase project dashboard as instructed in  to enable email verification.
- **On-Chain Logic:** Replace the simulated NFT minting with a real Solana smart contract.
- **Stripe Integration:** Implement real payments for the G Lounge subscription.
- **Multiplayer Game:** Convert the client-side game to a real-time multiplayer experience with a dedicated server.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to troubleshoot and resolve issues with the newly integrated Supabase authentication flow.

**User-Reported Problem:**
The user successfully registers an account and sees a Check your email to verify your account message, but they never receive the verification email. The UI then reverts to the previous state without providing persistent feedback, causing confusion.

**AI Engineer's Diagnosis and Actions:**
1.  **Diagnosis:** The AI concluded that the Supabase project was not configured to send emails because the default email templates were disabled or not set up. This is a required manual step in Supabase. The initial invalid API key error was also resolved by adding the  to the  file and the  client.
2.  **Code Changes:** The  function in  was updated to provide better UI feedback. It now shows a persistent message after registration, informing the user that a verification email has been sent and they need to check their inbox, preventing the UI from reverting silently.
3.  **Documentation:** The AI created , a markdown file containing explicit, step-by-step instructions for the user on how to enable and customize the Confirm signup email template within their Supabase project dashboard, including inserting the custom logo.

The work stopped right after providing this guide to the user, with the core issue being a manual configuration step the user must perform outside the application's codebase.

<optional_next_step>
Follow up with the user to ensure they have followed the instructions in  to configure their email templates in the Supabase dashboard, as this is required to fix the email verification issue.
